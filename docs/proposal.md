# JS Hero (JavaScript Hero)
## Background and Overview
Guitar Hero is a musical timing game where the user must hit the correct note at the correct time to receive points and move onto the next level.

## Functionality & MVP
Users will be able to:
 - [X] Play a song pressing keys on the keyboard at the correct time
 - [X] Hear and see feedback if they are playing correctly
 - [X] Start and mute a song

The project will also include:
 - [X] Links to connect with me (GitHub, LinkedIn)
 - [X] A modal with instructions on how to play
 - [X] 3D animation using Three.js

## Wireframes
The app will be a single screen, housing a canvas (possibly Three.js if time) where the notes are played, a dropdown for difficulty, links to GitHub and LinkedIn, and other display items shown on the following wireframe:

  * Webpack for bundling scripts

## Implementation Timeline
#### Over the Weekend:
 - [X] Tutorials on three.js
 - [X] Setup `webpack`, index.html, and entry.js file
